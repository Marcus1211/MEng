# Test
This folder contains all programs and scrips to test the correctness of distributed k-core decomposition algorithm.
The testing is using blackbox testing methodology.
The k-core of each node in the test graph will be calculated by Bienstockâ€“Zuckerberg algorithm (BZ algorithm) to check the correctness.
We also added synthetic test graph to test the edge cases of different graphs and manually calculate the k-core of each node as reference. 
## Prerequisite
- Golang version: 1.22
- Steps in the `preparation` folder need to be completed before conducting this experiment.
## What's in this repository

### - bz-origin.go
This go program implement the BZ algorithm to calculate the k-core of each node. 
The program takes the `json` formated graph data from the `preparation` folder as input and save the core number of each node into a text file.
### - small_test_graph
This folder contains all the synthetic graphs to test the edge cases of the different graphs
Cases:
- Cirecle graph: All nodes in this graph form a circle.
- Linear graph: All nodes in this graph form a linear line.
- Missing edge: Some of the edges are missing in this graph. e.g node A knows neighbour B but Node B does not know the neighbour A. This can be used for testing directed graphs.
- Missing node: Some of the nodes are missing in this graph. e.g Node A know neighbour B but Node B is missing in this graph data.
- Small graph: This is the normal graph that can be used for regular testing/troubleshoot purpose.

### - small_test_graph_result
All k-core of small test graphs are saved in to text files stored in this folder. This is used to check the correctness of BZ algorithm and Distributed k-core decomposition algorithm
### - test-small-graph.sh
This script automatically runs `bz-origin.go` program and `distributed-k-core.go` program against all small test graphs. The result of each run is saved into a text file for future analysis. Exectute following command to run the programs

### - test-snap-graph.sh
This script automatically runs `bz-origin.go` program against all downloaded graphs in the `preparation` folder. The result for each graph is saved into a text file for future analysis. 

## How to use this repository
1. Navigate to the same directory where the `test-small-graph.sh` is. Execute following command
    ```shell
    ./test-small-graph.sh
    ```
2. Once `preparation` steps are completed, execute following command
    ```shell
    ./test-snap-graph.sh
    ```
2. The results of each simulation will be saved in to different log files for future analysis.
